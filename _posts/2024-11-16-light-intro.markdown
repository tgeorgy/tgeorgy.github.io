*Grow lights consume more energy than they could. Whatâ€™s crazy is that it is happening for a wrong reason - both light plans and fixtures are simply under-engineered. Here's what is missing and what could be done better.*

When you optimize light for efficiency your ultimate goal must be to convert as much electrical energy as possible into photosynthesis. There are two sides to it.
1. **Converting electricity into usable light** - This is the first thing people consider when they talk about energy efficiency and it is only a part of it. LED manufacturers and many of the grow light companies do a great job here.
2. **Delivering photons to plants without wasting too much on the way.** Somehow people usually assume that this is solved by light planning. In most cases it is not.

Let's take a look at some images. Have you ever seen a glowing greenhouse at night? A beautiful mix of purple and warm yellow lights?

All of the light you see is **wasted** and it should have been absorbed by the plants instead.

The second best option is to at least make sure that the light is focused on the plants.

# Lighting planing limitations
Light planning is deceptively simple if you don't think too much about it. There are many simulation tools you can use that do the same thing - help you to figure out how many fixtures you need and where to place them. Your inputs are growing area layout and your fixture light spread - how much energy is emitted by a single fixture in what direction.

The next step is to tweak the light installation layout to balance light uniformity vs energy loss.

The reality is that it doesn't matter what you do and how you place them - you get more light in some areas than others and you end up with a choice - getting underdeveloped plants or wasting some energy.

The root cause for the trade off is that there's just not much you can do with fixed light fixtures. Each greenhouse layout is different. Plants are different. However all lights are built in the same way - *average*. Most of the time you cannot customize the lights and you end up with suboptimal efficiency.

# A beam of hope?
The only way to make grow light truly efficient is to control the light spread with higher precision. Think about car headlights.

They are designed to focus light on the lane ahead and avoid blinding incoming traffic. The pattern is very specific and predefined. This is achieved by optimizing lenses and reflectors.

We could do the same for greenhouses, except for lenses and now would also need to figure out configurable reflector design and a way to find right parameters. Both of them are easily within reach - the first one is solved with mechanical design and the second one is math and optimization.

With a little bit of engineering, we could be optimizing placement, angles, and reflector parameters, orchestrating them for a close to perfect light distribution.

With custom reflectors we could retrofit exiting light fixtures. And with controlled light spread optimized with physical simulation we could be delivering right amount of light anywhere - in traditional greenhouses, vertical farms or for any shape or form aeroponics.
